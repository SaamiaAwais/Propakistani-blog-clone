inDrive, a global mobility and urban services platform, has emerged as the top-ranked app in Pakistan’s Maps & Navigation category, according to the latest rankings on Google Play Store. The app also ranks first in the Travel category on Apple’s App Store. The development marks a significant moment in the country’s evolving mobility landscape, especially amid shifting user expectations.</p>
<p>Launched in Pakistan in 2021, inDrive operates in over 20 cities and is built around a peer-to-peer pricing model that allows riders and drivers to negotiate fares directly — a key point of difference from traditional platforms that use surge-based algorithms. <br><br>
The platform’s recent rise in app store rankings comes at a time when affordability and control are at the forefront for urban commuters. “Our model resonates because it puts people first – they decide the price, not an algorithm,” said Awais Saeed, Country Manager for inDrive Pakistan.</p>
<p>He added, “inDrive’s growth has been largely organic, driven by local adoption and a focus on expanding into underserved areas. We are also investing in social impact programs, including support for drivers’ families, upcoming training initiatives, and the planned onboarding of women drivers.”
<br><br>
inDrive’s momentum is tied to the growing demand for safety, transparency and rider autonomy, particularly in Pakistan’s price-sensitive urban centres. inDrive’s unique model allows riders to propose a fare based on distance, time, or what they feel is fair, and drivers can choose to accept, reject, or negotiate.
<br><br>
Beyond ride-hailing, inDrive also connects people through a range of services, including courier, freight delivery, city-to-city travel and B2B solutions. Globally, the platform continues to grow, ranked as the second-most downloaded ride-hailing app worldwide for the third consecutive year, and placing fifth in the global travel app category.</p>
